Dale Carnegie began teaching his first
public speaking course in 1912 for the YMCA at 125th
Street in New York City. In those days, public speaking
was regarded as an art, rather than as a skill, and its
teaching aims were directed toward producing orators
and platform giants of the silver-tongued variety. The
average business or professional man who merely
wanted to express himself with more ease and self-confidence
in his own milieu did not wish to spend his time
or money studying mechanics of speech, voice production,
rules of rhetoric, and formalized gestures. Dale
Carnegie's courses in effective speaking were immediately
successful because they gave these men the results
they wanted. Dale approached public speaking not as a
fine art requiring special talents and aptitude, but as a
skill which any normally intelligent person could acquire
and develop at will.

Today, the Dale Carnegie courses circle the globe
and the validity of Dale Carnegie's concept is attested
to by thousands of his students everywhere, men and
women from every walk of life, who have successfully
improved their speaking as well as their personal effectiveness.

The textbook Dale Carnegie wrote for his courses,
Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business, went
through more than fifty printings, was translated into
eleven languages, and was revised by Dale Carnegie
several times to keep pace with his own increased
knowledge and experience. More people used the book
each year than the combined enrollments of the largest
universities.

The fourth revision of the book has been based upon
my husband's own notes and ideas. The title is one
which he himself chose before his work was interrupted
by death. I have tried to keep in mind his basic philosophy,
that effective speaking is more than "saying a few
words" to an audience: it is the revealing expression of
a human personality.

Every activity of our lives is communication of a sort,
but it is through speech that man asserts his distinctiveness
from other forms of life. He alone, of all animals,
has the gift of verbal communication, and it is through
the quality of his speech that he best expresses his own
individuality, his essence. When he is unable to say
clearly what he means, through either nervousness, timidity,
or foggy thought-processes, his personality is
blocked off, dimmed out, and misunderstood.

Business, social, and personal satisfaction depend
heavily upon a person's ability to communicate clearly
to his fellow men what he is, what he desires, and what
he believes in. And now, as never before, in an atmosphere
of international tensions, fears, and insecurities,
we need the channels of communication between peoples
kept.open. It is my hope that The Quick and Easy
Way to Effective Speaking will be helpful in all these
ways, both to those who wish merely to function with
greater ease and self-confidence in practical pursuits,
and to those who wish to express themselves more completely
as individuals seeking a deeper personal fulfillment.
