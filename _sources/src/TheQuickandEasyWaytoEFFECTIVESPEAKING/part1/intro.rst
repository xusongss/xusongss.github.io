PART ONE: Fundamentals of Effective Speaking
==========================================================================

In every art there are few principles and many techniques.


In the chapters that make up the first part of this book,
we discuss the basic principles of effective speaking and
the attitudes to make these principles come alive.

As adults, we are interested in a quick and easy way to
speak effectively. The only way we can achieve results
quickly is to have the right attitude about achieving our
goal and a firm foundation of principles to build upon.
