Tackling Anxiety
=================================

Anxiety and depression are widespread mental health disorders, affecting 4% of the global population with only a quarter receiving treatment. This article explores how anxiety :ref:`manifests<manifest>` in the mind and body and offers strategies for self-management. Cognitive anxiety, characterized by negative thoughts and :ref:`ruminations<ruminate>`, benefits from approaches like cognitive :ref:`reframing<reframe>`.  :ref:`Somatic<somatic>` anxiety, which presents physically, can be managed through techniques such as Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR). Understanding these aspects and empowering oneself with education can significantly aid in overcoming anxiety.

Anxiety and depression are the most common mental health disorders worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 4% of the global population experience an anxiety disorder, yet only 1 in 4 receive treatment. In the United States,over 19% of adults and 31% of :ref:`adolescents<adolescent>` are estimated to live with an anxiety disorder in any given year.

While :ref:`therapy<therapy>` and professional support are crucial in addressing anxiety, empowering yourself through education on its origins and implementing effective self-support strategies can also have a significant impact. This article introduces foundational concepts about how anxiety manifests in the mind and body, and it offers practical strategies to help you overcome it.

Anxiety lives in our brain and body
==================================================================


Even though many people encounter anxiety, the nature and the intensity of their experience can vary widely. For some, anxiety manifests through dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, while others may feel it as :ref:`chronic<chronic>` physical :ref:`symptoms<symptom>` like stomach aches, headaches, or disrupted sleep. Sometimes, people experience a mix of these different symptoms.

If you struggle with anxiety, it can be helpful to understand the underlying :ref:`neuroscience<neuroscience>`.This knowledge not only clarifies the root cause but also guides you to the most effective tools for managing it. The first exercise is to figure out if your anxiety is mostly cognitive or somatic. Let’s explore each of them (1, 2).

Cognitive anxiety
==================================================================

Cognitive anxiety often manifests through negative thoughts, persistent ruminations, and self-doubt. This type of anxiety may involve :ref:`anticipatory<anticipatory>` worries about the future and is often accompanied by negative self-talk, such as “I’m not capable enough” or “I’m worthless.” It originates from our thought processes and is a pattern that we are aware of,although we may not always feel in control of it.

Decades of research indicate that cognitive anxiety does not **stem from** a single gene,brain region, or neurotransmitter; rather, it results from altered brain processing
(3). At its core, cognitive anxiety involves a disrupted connection between two key brain regions:the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala. The PFC plays a crucial role in regulating our conscious behaviors, thoughts, and emotions, while the amygdala is :ref:`renowned<renown>` as the center for our fear response (it’s important to note that the amygdala is involved in much more than fear, playing an important role in our memory formation and motivation).

The PFC and amygdala work in :ref:`concert` with other brain areas, but their connection is particularly vital in managing anxiety. In individuals with anxiety, studies show that the amygdala tends to be :ref:`hyperactive`, and its communication with the PFC is less effective.This imbalance means that those experiencing cognitive anxiety may struggle more to :ref:`dampen` amygdala activity through PFC regulation. This difficulty helps explain persistent rumination about the past or chronic worry about the future—instances where the PFC struggles to exert its usual regulatory “brake” on the amygdala.

Addressing cognitive anxiety often benefits from a “Top Down” approach, focusing onaltering thought patterns to engage the PFC actively and thereby reduce amygdalaactivity.

Somatic anxiety
==================================================================

In contrast to cognitive anxiety, which manifests in our thoughts and brain, somaticanxiety expresses itself in the rest of our body. Symptoms can include numbness, feelinghot, increased heart rate, headaches, stomach aches, and muscle tension. It is nowwidely recognized among healthcare providers and researchers that individuals withanxiety disorders are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders (4, 5) . If you’ve read The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, Trauma and the Body by Pat Ogden,or In an Unspoken Voice by Peter A. Levine, you’re likely familiar with stories of peopleexperiencing somatic anxiety.

Compared to cognitive anxiety, there is less research on the roots and characteristics ofsomatic anxiety, which is inherently more complex due to its involvement with multiplesystems throughout the body, including nerve endings in our skin and gut. The mostchallenging aspect is that much of this processing occurs unconsciously, making it difficultfor individuals to recognize that their symptoms are anxiety-related. This often leads tountreated cases and negative experiences with gastro-intestinal doctors, dermatologists,and rheumatologists who may not understand why standard treatments are ineffective. Iffortunate, these individuals may eventually see a specialized psychiatrist orpsychotherapist who can guide them through somatic therapy.

Although the name may not reveal it, somatic anxiety is represented in the brain, albeitdifferently than cognitive anxiety. Whereas cognitive anxiety heavily involves the cortico-limbic networks (for example the connection between the PFC and amygdala), somaticanxiety is represented in different sets of brain regions, including the insula (which isimportant for sensing our inner state) and our sensorimotor cortex (important forperceiving sensations and executing movements) (6) . Newer research suggests that it’sthe hyperactivation of these sensory areas in our brain that lead our body to respond withhypervigilance to sensory input (6) . In other words, somatic anxiety is rooted in the brain,but it’s physically expressed in the body. This means that when we address anxiety, weneed to implement methods to change how the brain is responding to and processingsensory input.

Cognitive and somatic anxiety can happen to anyone with anykind of anxiety disorder
====================================================================================================================================

It’s important to recognize that everyone can experience somatic and cognitive anxiety,regardless of their type of anxiety diagnosis. While certain experiences, such aschildhood sexual abuse, are more likely to result in somatic anxiety (7) , it’s impossible tostrictly categorize anxieties into somatic or cognitive groups. For instance, one personwith post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might predominantly experience somaticsymptoms, while another might experience more cognitive symptoms.

Therefore, it is crucial to approach your symptoms with an open mind and seek outexperts and support groups that can help you identify and implement techniques mosteffective for your specific symptoms.

Different anxieties require different tools
====================================================================================================================================

If the mechanism of anxiety resides in different parts of the brain, then we need to lean ondistinct strategies that can target each of these. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(CBT) is an effective method for all types of anxieties, it may be less beneficial for thosewho experience somatic anxiety symptoms (8) . CBT focuses on engaging and changingthought patterns, and because somatic anxiety manifests in the body, often outside ofconscious awareness, CBT’s “Top Down” approach may not be effective. Instead, somatictherapy approaches emphasize (re-)engaging the mind-body connection, which can beparticularly helpful in the context of somatic anxiety ( 9 ). When seeking a therapist, it’simportant to consider whether they have experience in treating your specific type ofanxiety. Below, I provide insights into two evidence-based techniques to help you manageyour unique expression of anxiety.

Cognitive reframing through Thought Records
====================================================================================================================================

If you are dealing with cognitive anxiety, cognitive reframing is likely a method that’suseful for you. Cognitive reframing involves “interrogating” your recurrent anxiousthoughts and replacing them with an alternative, more balanced thought pattern. Thistechnique can be aided by using Thought Records, an integral tool in CBT that you caneasily use on your own.

The purpose of Thought Records is to identify patterns of thinking that contribute toemotional distress, and to challenge and reframe these thoughts, and a typical ThoughtRecord includes the following sections:

    1. Situation  : Describing the context or event that triggered the negativethoughts.  
    2.  Automatic Thoughts  : Recording the spontaneous, often negative thoughtsthatarose in response to the situation.  
    3.  Emotions  : Noting the feelings experienced as a result of the automaticthoughts, often with an intensity rating.  
    4.  Evidencefor the Thought  : Listing the evidence that supports the automaticthought.  
    5.  Evidence Against the Thought  : Identifying the evidence that contradicts theautomaticthought.  
    6.  Alternative/Balanced Thoughts  : Formulating more balanced or realisticthoughts based on the evidence.  
    7.  Outcome  : Recording any changes in emotionsor behaviors after reframingthe thoughts.

A completed Thought Record might look like this:

    1. Situation : I flunked a work presentation in front of the top leadership and mysupervisor. 
    2. Automatic Thoughts : I feel like a total failure. I don’t understand why theyhaven’t fired me. I don’t deserve to be in my current role. 
    3. Emotions : I’m frustrated (8 out of 10), sad (7 out of 10), embarrassed (8 outof 10), and angry with myself (9 out of 10). 
    4. Evidence for the Thought : I have been late to a few meetings lately, I feltoverwhelmed with my responsibilities, and I have not been as prepared asusual. 

    5. Evidence Against the Thought : The recent death of my mother made mefeel sad and hopeless. Before her death I was typically always timely andprepared. I’m doing the best I can to navigate work and grief.

    6. Alternative/Balanced Thoughts : Right now, I’m going through a difficult time.My performance will improve as I process the grief. I’m a responsible andcapable person, but right now I need to focus on grieving and cut myself someslack. 

    7. Outcome : I’m less frustrated (3 out of 10), sad (0 out of 10), embarrassed (1out of 10), and angry with myself (0 out of 10). I feel more relaxed (7 out of10) and capable (8 out of 10).

Regularly practicing this exercise can help you shift your “automatic” thought patterns,making you less likely to engage in negative self-talk, catastrophizing the future, orruminating on the past. It also serves as a valuable tool for increasing self-awareness andpromoting healthier thinking patterns overall. If you find that Thought Records haven’tworked for you in the past, you may benefit from fine-tuning your approach, as discussed in this blog .

Researchers have discovered that after undergoing CBT, which heavily utilizes cognitivereframing and Thought Records, brain areas in the cortical and limbic networks exhibitaltered activity consistent with reduced anxiety. This change supports the notion that CBThelps us better regulate our negative thoughts and feelings (10, 11).

Increasing Parasympathetic Activity through Progressive MuscleRelaxation
====================================================================================================================================

Cognitive reframing requires us to be aware of and engage with our thoughts andfeelings. An alternative strategy is to tackle anxiety from “Bottom Up”, which focuses onconnecting your mind and body without delving into the triggers, thoughts, and behaviors.

One effective “Bottom Up” strategy is Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), a powerfultechnique for those struggling with relaxation. This method involves actively contractingmuscles to create tension, then progressively releasing it. You repeat this routine forevery muscle group in your body, until you achieve a state of relaxation. While more research is needed, studies have found that intentional muscle contraction engages thesensorimotor cortex, and the gradual release of tension activates brain areas importantfor sensing our body’s state. (12, 13) .

You can find various YouTube videos and podcasts online providing you with guidedPMR. Below is an example of what the script may sound like:

    #. Start with taking five deep breaths. Make sure you can feel your belly expandwith every breath.
    #. Squeeze your feet for five seconds. Release the tension and relax.
    #. Squeeze your calf muscles for five seconds. Release.
    #. Squeeze your thigh muscles for five seconds. Release.
    #. Squeeze your stomach muscles for five seconds. Release.
    #. Shrug your shoulders up towards your ears for five seconds. Release.
    #. Squeeze your upper arm muscles for five seconds. Release.
    #. Squeeze your lower arm muscles for five seconds. Release.
    #. Squeeze your hands into fists. Release.
    #. Open your jaw as much as you can and hold it for five seconds. Release.
    #. Squeeze your eyes closed for five seconds. Release.
    #. Tighten your forehead muscles for five seconds. Release.
    #. Take five deep breaths. Make sure you can feel your belly expand with everybreath.
    #. Continue this routine until you feel more relaxed.

Ideally, you’ll be sitting comfortably in a chair or lying down on a soft surface as you movethrough this sequence. If you struggle with anxiety-induced insomnia, then PMR is anexcellent tool for pre-bedtime routines.

Empowerment through Education
====================================================================================================================================

Navigating anxiety can be challenging and overwhelming. You may have experiencedjudgment from loved ones, discrimination in the workspace, or bullying by healthcareproviders. While these experiences are neither comfortable nor uncommon, they do notreflect your opportunity for recovery and betterment. Anxiety, whether cognitive or somaticor both, can be managed and even treated entirely with the right support.

A first step that many people find empowering is to educate themselves more about theroots of their challenges, enabling them to better understand what they need to improveand articulate that need to the people around them. Sometimes, simply sounding moreconfident can get you a referral from a resistant healthcare provider, or feeling confidentabout sharing the science of anxiety can help you push back against bullies. Moreover,keep in mind that over 19% of adults and 30% of adolescents in the US have an anxietydisorder , and many more have experiences with anxiety either currently or in the past.You are not alone, and chances are that the people around you understand more thanyou think.
