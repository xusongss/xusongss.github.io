<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Do you often go to coffee shops? Why or why not?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>“Yes, I often go to coffee shops, especially on weekends. I enjoy the atmosphere because it’s cozy and relaxing. Also, I like trying different types of coffee and sometimes meeting friends there. It’s a nice break from my daily routine.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Yes, I often go to coffee shops, especially on weekends. It’s a nice place for meeting friends and relaxing. I also enjoy trying different kinds of coffee. Sometimes, I like to read a book there or listen to music.”</p></li>
<li><p>“No, actually, I like tea more, but sometimes I go to coffee shops with friends. It’s a nice place to relax. Occasionally, I like to read a book there and listen to music.”</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>What do you like or dislike about coffee shops?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>“I like the cozy atmosphere of coffee shops, especially when I’m with my best friends. It’s a comfortable place where we can talk and relax. I also enjoy the smell of fresh coffee and the background music. Sometimes, the noise can be a little distracting, but overall, I find coffee shops very welcoming.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I really enjoy the cozy atmosphere in coffee shops, especially when I’m with my best friends. It’s a comfortable and relaxing place where we can chat and spend quality time together. I also like the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the soft background music, which creates a pleasant environment. However, sometimes coffee shops can get quite noisy or crowded, which makes it harder to concentrate if I want to read or work. Overall, I think coffee shops are great places to unwind and socialize.”</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>How often do you visit coffee shops?</p>
<p>“Actually, I only occasionally visit coffee shops because I’m a father of a young child, so I don’t have enough time. Most of the time, when I meet friends, we choose to go to a coffee shop because I think it’s a nice place to talk. The atmosphere helps everyone feel relaxed and comfortable.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do you prefer to go to big chain coffee shops or small independent ones? Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Oh! That’s a good question. Although I sometimes go to small independent coffee shops, I actually prefer big chain ones. I like the cozy atmosphere in big chain cafés, which smaller shops often lack. Another reason, at least in China, is that the prices at big chains are more consistent, while prices at independent shops can vary depending on the location.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Have coffee shops changed in your country in recent years?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Yes, in my opinion, coffee shops have changed a lot over the last few decades. When I was a college student in 2006, there were hardly any coffee shops near our school—not even in big shopping malls. In recent years, though, you can find a coffee shop almost anywhere whenever you want a cup of coffee. In fact, the change is not just limited to coffee shops, but can be seen across many sectors. I think it’s partly the result of China joining the WTO and opening up more to international business.”</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1.3.1. </span>☕ A Cup of Change: My Journey Through Coffee Shops<a class="headerlink" href="#a-cup-of-change-my-journey-through-coffee-shops" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When I was a college student back in 2006, coffee shops were nearly invisible in my daily life. At that time, I studied in a city where cafés were rare—even in the biggest shopping malls. I had never really thought about coffee as a part of my routine. Tea was more common and familiar, and if I wanted to meet friends, we would usually go to a noodle shop or a quiet park. But things began to change, slowly at first, and then all at once.</p>
<p>Now, nearly two decades later, coffee shops have become an ordinary part of daily life. In almost every neighborhood or business district, there’s at least one cozy café offering everything from espresso to soy milk lattes. Big international chains have expanded rapidly, bringing a sense of consistency and comfort to customers across the country. When I step into one, I already know what to expect—the same menu, the same friendly atmosphere, and the same price, no matter where I am.</p>
<p>Although I still prefer tea in my daily life, I now occasionally visit coffee shops, especially when I want to meet friends. The soft music, the smell of freshly brewed coffee, and the quiet hum of conversations make these places feel calm and welcoming. Sometimes, when I get the chance, I bring a book with me and enjoy a peaceful moment away from my busy life as a father. It’s not just about the drink—it’s about the space it creates.</p>
<p>The rise of coffee shops in my country reflects a much bigger change. It’s not just about coffee—it’s about culture, lifestyle, and how international influences have shaped our everyday habits. I believe this transformation is partly due to China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which opened the door to global businesses and consumer choices. Today, the café is no longer just a place to drink coffee; it’s a symbol of how quickly and deeply our lives have evolved.</p>

<p>Topic: Coffee shops have become increasingly popular in many countries. What are the reasons for this trend? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, coffee shops have become increasingly popular across many parts of the world, including in my own country. While tea was once the dominant beverage in many cultures, the emergence of coffee culture reflects broader social and economic changes. In this essay, I will explore the reasons for this trend and explain why I believe it is a largely positive development.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons behind the growing popularity of coffee shops is globalization. International coffee chains such as Starbucks and Costa have expanded rapidly, offering a consistent experience that appeals to consumers around the world. In China, for instance, coffee shops were rare in the early 2000s, even in large cities. When I was a university student in 2006, it was difficult to find a café near campus or even in major shopping malls. However, in recent years, coffee shops have become a common sight, reflecting the influence of global trade and cultural exchange, particularly after China joined the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>In addition to globalization, lifestyle changes have contributed to the rise of coffee shop culture. For many people, cafés offer more than just beverages; they serve as social hubs, informal meeting spots, and quiet places to read or work. Personally, although I still prefer tea in daily life, I often visit coffee shops with friends. The cozy atmosphere, pleasant background music, and comfortable seating make them ideal spaces for relaxation and conversation. As a father with limited free time, I also appreciate the opportunity to enjoy a few quiet moments in such an environment.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe the spread of coffee shops is a positive development. It provides consumers with greater choice, supports social interaction, and reflects a modern lifestyle that values both productivity and comfort. While it is important to preserve traditional practices such as tea culture, the coexistence of old and new habits adds richness to our society.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the rise of coffee shops is driven by both global influences and changes in local lifestyles. As long as it does not replace traditional values entirely, this trend represents progress and cultural openness in a rapidly modernizing world.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.1.1.5. </span>Story: The First Time I Met My Wife – At a Coffee Shop<a class="headerlink" href="#story-the-first-time-i-met-my-wife-at-a-coffee-shop" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>It was a rainy afternoon, many years ago, before my wife and I were married. Back then, we didn’t even know each other. A friend of mine had invited me to meet up at a small local coffee shop. I arrived a bit early, ordered a cappuccino, and sat by the window watching the rain.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, my friend walked in—with someone I had never seen before. That someone was her. She smiled at me as we were introduced, and I still remember how warm and friendly her smile was. We talked for a while, just casual conversation about books and music, but something about that moment felt special.</p>
<p>From that day on, we started to see each other more often. We met again at that same coffee shop many times—sometimes just the two of us, sometimes with friends. Looking back now, I realize that little coffee shop was where everything truly began for us. It’s still one of our favorite places.</p>

<p>The First Time I Met My Wife — A Coffee Shop Story</p>
<p>It’s often said that some places hold special memories, and for me, a small coffee shop in my hometown is one such place. This humble café is where I met my wife for the very first time — a moment that changed my life forever. Even though it was many years ago, the memory of that rainy afternoon remains vivid in my mind, and I love to share this story because it’s about love, chance encounters, and how simple places can sometimes become the setting for life’s most important moments.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Setting the Scene</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Back then, I was a university student, just starting to explore adulthood and all its possibilities. Like many young people, I enjoyed spending my free time at cafés, which offered a cozy and relaxed atmosphere far different from the hectic classroom environment. That particular day was rainy and gloomy, a perfect excuse to stay indoors and enjoy a warm drink. I remember the smell of freshly ground coffee beans mixing with the soft background music that played quietly in the shop.</p>
<p>I arrived at the café a little earlier than my friend, who had invited me to meet some new people. After ordering a cappuccino — my usual choice — I settled down by the window, watching the raindrops race each other down the glass. It was one of those moments when the outside world seemed to slow down, allowing me a brief escape from the daily pressures of life.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The Unexpected Meeting</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Not long after, the door opened and in walked my friend — accompanied by a young woman I had never seen before. When I was introduced to her, I immediately noticed her warm smile and friendly eyes. We exchanged greetings, and the conversation began casually, revolving around books, music, and the small details of daily life. At first, it was just polite small talk, but there was an undeniable connection, something intangible that made me want to know more.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realize how significant that simple meeting was. We sat there for hours without noticing the time passing, talking about everything and nothing all at once. It was as if the coffee shop had become a small bubble where the outside world didn’t exist — a perfect setting for two strangers to slowly become friends.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Why Coffee Shops Are Special</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Cafés like that one hold a special place in many people’s hearts. They offer more than just coffee; they provide a social space where people can relax, connect, and create memories. The cozy atmosphere, the soft hum of conversations, and the comforting aroma of coffee beans all combine to make these places unique.</p>
<p>For my wife and me, that coffee shop was the backdrop to the beginning of our relationship. We met there several times afterward, each visit strengthening our bond. Sometimes we would just sit quietly, enjoying each other’s company without saying much. Other times, we would bring friends and share laughter and stories. The coffee shop became our sanctuary — a place that witnessed the early stages of our love story.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The Role of Chance and Fate</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It’s fascinating how life often hinges on chance encounters. I never expected that a casual meeting in a coffee shop would lead to marriage and a family. Yet, it’s a reminder that sometimes the most important things in life happen unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The story also shows the power of shared spaces in bringing people together. Coffee shops, parks, libraries — these everyday places can become the scenes of meaningful human connections. For many people, they are more than just businesses; they are cultural hubs that foster community and interaction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Reflections on Change and Growth</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Since that day, the coffee shop where we met has changed a lot, much like my own life. The city has grown, and so have we. But the memory of that first meeting remains a constant source of joy and nostalgia. Whenever I return to that café, I feel a deep sense of gratitude — not just for the coffee, but for the moment it gave me, the beginning of a lifelong journey with the person I love.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Using IELTS Phrases and Vocabulary</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Throughout this story, I’ve used some common IELTS phrases that you might find useful when talking about personal experiences or describing places and feelings. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“It’s often said that…”</p></li>
<li><p>“The memory remains vivid in my mind.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A cozy and relaxed atmosphere.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A perfect excuse to stay indoors.”</p></li>
<li><p>“An undeniable connection.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A small bubble where the outside world didn’t exist.”</p></li>
<li><p>“The backdrop to the beginning of our relationship.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A reminder that sometimes the most important things in life happen unexpectedly.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Cultural hubs that foster community and interaction.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A deep sense of gratitude.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using these phrases helps to make your story sound natural, fluent, and engaging — all qualities that IELTS examiners look for.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In conclusion, the coffee shop where I first met my wife is more than just a place to drink coffee. It represents chance, connection, and the beginning of a beautiful relationship. It shows how ordinary places can become extraordinary memories, and how sometimes, life’s most meaningful moments happen in the simplest settings. I hope this story inspires you to appreciate the everyday places in your own life — you never know what surprises they might hold.</p>
