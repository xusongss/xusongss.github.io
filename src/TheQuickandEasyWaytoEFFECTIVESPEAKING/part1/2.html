<p>“Five years ago, Mr. Carnegie, I came to the hotel where you were conducting one of your demonstrations. I walked up to the door of the meeting room and then stopped. I knew if I entered that room and joined a class, sooner or later Fd have to make a speech. My hand froze on the doorknob. I couldn’t go in. I turned my back and walked out of the hotel.”</p>
<p>“If I had only known then how you make it easy to conquer fear, the paralyzing fear of an audience, I wouldn’t have lost these past five years.”</p>
<p>The man who spoke these revealing words wasn’t talking across a table or a desk. He was directing his remarks to an audience of some two hundred people. It was the graduation session of one of my courses in New York City. As he gave his talk, I was particularly impressed by his poise and self-assurance. Here was a man, I thought, whose executive skills will be tremendously increased by his newly acquired expressiveness and confidence. As his instructor, I was delighted to see that <strong>he had dealt a death blow to fear</strong>, and I couldn’t help thinking how much more successful, and what is more, how much happier this man would have been if his victory over fear had come five or ten years before.</p>
<p>Emerson said, “Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world.” Oh, how I have been made aware of the bitter truth of that statement. And how grateful I am that during my life I have been able to rescue people from fear. When I started to teach my course in 1912, little did I realize that this training would prove to be one of the best methods ever yet devised to help people eliminate their fears and feelings of <a class="reference internal" href="../../vocabulary/600.html#inferiority"><span class="std std-ref">inferiority</span></a>. I found that learning to speak in public is nature’s own method of overcoming self-consciousness and building up courage and self-confidence. Why? Because speaking in public makes us come to <a class="reference internal" href="../../vocabulary/2025-08/01.html#grips-with"><span class="std std-ref">grips with</span></a> our fears.</p>
<p>In years of training men and women to speak in public, I have picked up some ideas to help you quickly overcome stage <a class="reference internal" href="../../vocabulary/2025-07/31.html#fright"><span class="std std-ref">fright</span></a> and develop confidence in a few short weeks of practice.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.2.2.1. </span>FIRST: GET THE FACTS ABOUT FEAR OF SPEAKING IN PUBLIC<a class="headerlink" href="#first-get-the-facts-about-fear-of-speaking-in-public" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Fact Number One:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You are not unique in your fear of speaking in public. Surveys in colleges indicate that eighty to ninety percent of all students enrolled in speech classes suffer from stage fright at the beginning of the course. I am inclined to believe that the figure is higher among adults at the start of my course, almost one hundred percent.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Fact Number Two:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A certain amount of stage fright is useful! It is nature’s way of preparing us to meet unusual challenges in our environment. So, when you notice your pulse beating faster and your respiration speeding up, don’t become alarmed. Your body, ever alert to external stimuli, is getting ready to go into action. If these physiological preparations are held within limits, you will be capable of thinking faster, talking more fluently, and generally speaking with greater intensity than under normal circumstances.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Fact Number Three:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Many professional speakers have assured me that they never completely lose all stage fright. It is almost always present just before they speak, and it may persist through the first few sentences of their talk. This is the price these men and women pay for being like race horses and not like draft horses. Speakers who say they are “cool as a cucumber” at all times are usually as thick-skinned as a cucumber and about as inspiring as a cucumber.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Fact Number Four:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The chief cause of your fear of public speaking is simply that you are unaccustomed to speak in public. “Fear is misbegotten of ignorance and uncertainty” says Professor Robinson in The Mind in the Making. For most people, public speaking is an unknown quantity, and consequently one fraught with anxiety and fear factors. For the beginner, it is a complex series of strange situations, more involved than, say, learning to play tennis or drive a car. To make this fearful situation simple and easy: practice, practice, practice. You will find, as thousands upon thousands have, that public speaking can be made a joy instead of an agony merely by getting a record of successful speaking experiences behind you.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The story of how Albert Edward Wiggam, the prominent
lecturer and popular psychologist, overcame his
fear, has been an inspiration to me ever since I first
read it. He tells how terror-struck he was at the
thought of standing up in high school and delivering a
five-minute declamation.</p>
<p>“As the day approached,” he writes, “I became positively
ill. Whenever the dreadful thought occurred to
me, my whole head would flush with blood and my
cheeks would bum so painfully that I would go out behind
the school building and press them against the
cold brick wall to try to reduce their surging blushes. It
was the same way with me in college.</p>
<p>“On one occasion, I carefully memorized a declamation
beginning, ‘Adam and Jefferson are no more.’
When I faced the audience, my head was swimming so
I scarcely knew where I was. I managed to gasp out
the opening sentence, stating that ‘Adams and Jefferson
have passed away.’ I couldn’t say another word, so
I bowed … and walked solemnly back to my seat
amid great applause. The president got up and said,
‘Well, Edward, we are shocked to hear the sad news,
but we will do our best to bear up under the circumstances.’
During the uproarious laughter that followed,
death would surely have been a welcome relief. I was
ill for days afterward.</p>
<p>“Certainly the last thing on earth I ever expected to
become was a public speaker.”</p>
<p>A year after he left college, Albert Wiggam was in
Denver. The political campaign of 1896 was raging
over the issue of Free Silver. One day he read a pamphlet
explaining the proposals of the Free Silverites; he
became so incensed over what he considered the errors
and hollow promises of Bryan and his followers, that
he pawned his watch for enough money to get back to
his native Indiana. Once there, he offered his services
to speak on the subject of sound money. Many of his
old school friends were in the audience. “As I began,”
he writes, “the picture of my Adams and Jefferson
speech in college swept over me. I choked and stammered
and all seemed to be lost. But, as Chauncey Depew
often said, both the audience and I managed
somehow to live through the introduction; and encouraged by even this tiny success, I went on talking for
what I thought was about fifteen minutes. To my
amazement, I discovered I had been talking an hour
and a half!</p>
<p>“As a result, within the next few years, I was the
most surprised person in the world to find myself making
my living as a professional public speaker.</p>
<p>“I knew at first hand what William James meant by
the habit of success.”</p>
<p>Yes, Albert Edward Wiggam learned that one of the
surest ways of overcoming the devastating fear of
speaking before groups is to get a record of successful
experiences behind you.</p>
<p>You should expect a certain amount of fear as a
natural adjunct of your desire to speak in public, and
you should learn to depend on a limited amount of
stage fright to help make you give a better talk.</p>
<p>If stage fright gets out of hand and seriously curtails
your effectiveness by causing mental blocks, lack of fluency,
uncontrollable tics, and excessive muscular
spasm, you should not despair. These symptoms are
not unusual in beginners. If you make the effort, you
will find the degree of stage fright soon reduced to the
point where it will prove a help and not a hindrance.</p>

<p>The principal speaker at a New York Rotary Club
luncheon several years ago was a prominent government
official. We were looking forward to hearing him
describe the activities of his department.</p>
<p>It was obvious almost at once that he had not
planned his speech. At first he tried to talk impromptu.
Failing in that attempt, he pulled out of his pocket a
sheaf of notes which evidently had no more order than
a flatcar full of scrap iron. He fumbled awhile with
these, all the time becoming more embarrassed and
inept in his delivery. Minute by minute he became
more helpless, more bewildered. But he kept on floundering,
apologizing, trying to make some semblance of
sense out of his notes and raising a glass of water with
a trembling hand to his parched hps. He was a sad picture
of a man completely overcome by fright, due to
almost total lack of preparation. He finally sat down,
one of the most humiliated speakers I have ever seen.
He made his talk as Rousseau says a love letter should
be written: he began without knowing what he was going
to say, and finished without knowing what he had
said.</p>
<p>Since 1912, it has been my professional duty to evaluate
over five thousand talks a year. From that experience,
one great lesson stands out like Mt. Everest,
towering above all the others: only the prepared
speaker deserves to be confident. How can anyone ever
hope to storm the fortress of fear if he goes into battle
with defective weapons, or with no ammunition at all?
“I believe,” said Lincoln, “that I shall never be old
enough to speak without embarrassment when I have
nothing to say.”
If you want to develop confidence, why not do the
one thing that will give you security as a speaker?
“Perfect love,” wrote the Apostle John, “casteth out
fear.” So does perfect preparation. Daniel Webster said
he would as soon think of appearing before an audience
half-clothed as half-prepared.</p>
<section id="never-memorize-a-talk-word-for-word">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2.2.1. </span>NEVER MEMORIZE A TALK WORD FOR WORD<a class="headerlink" href="#never-memorize-a-talk-word-for-word" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>By “perfect preparation” do I mean that you should
memorize your talk? To this question I give back a
thunderous NO. In their attempts to protect their egos
from the dangers of drawing a mental blank before an
audience, many speakers fall headlong into the trap of
memorization. Once a victim of this type of mental
dope addiction, the speaker is hopelessly bound to a
time-consuming method of preparation that destroys
effectiveness on the platform.</p>
<p>When H. V. Kaltenborn, the dean of American news
commentators, was a student at Harvard University, he
took part in a speech contest. He selected a short story
entitled “Gentlemen, the King.” He memorized it word
for word and rehearsed it hundreds of times. The day
of the contest he announced the title, “Gentlemen, the
King.” Then his mind went blank. It not only went
blank; it went black. He was terrified. In desperation
he started telling the story in his own words. He was
the most surprised boy in the hall when the judges
gave him first prize. From that day to this, H. V. Kaltenborn
has never read nor memorized a speech. That
has been the secret of success in his broadcasting
career. He makes a few notes and talks naturally to his
listeners without a script.</p>
<p>The man who writes out and memorizes his talks is
wasting his time and energy, and courting disaster. All
our lives we have been speaking spontaneously. We
haven’t been thinking of words. We have been thinking
of ideas. If our ideas are clear, the words come as
naturally and unconsciously as the air we breathe.</p>
<p>Even Winston Churchill had to learn that lesson the
hard way. As a young man, Churchill wrote out and
memorized his speeches. Then one day, while delivering
a memorized talk before the British Parliament, he
stopped dead in his mental tracks. His mind went
blanlc. He was embarrassed, humiliated! He began his
last sentence all over again. Again his mind went blank
and his face scarlet. He sat down. From that day to
this, Winston Churchill has never attempted to deliver
a memorized talk.</p>
<p>If we memorize our talk word for word, we will
probably forget it when we face our listeners. Even if
we do not forget our memorized talk, we will probably
deliver it, in a mechanical way. Why? Because it will
not come from our hearts, but from our memories.
When talking with people privately, we always think of
something we want to say, and then we go ahead and
say it without thinking of words. We have been doing
that all our lives. Why attempt to change it now? If we
do write out and memorize our talks, we may have the
same experience that Vance Bushnell had.</p>
<p>Vance was a graduate of the Beaux Arts School in
Paris, and later became vice-president of one of the
largest insurance companies in the world—the Equitable
Life Assurance Society. Years ago, he was asked
to address a conference of two thousand Equitable Life
representatives from all over America at a meeting in
White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. At that time, he
had been in the life insurance business for only two
years, but he had been highly successful, so he was
scheduled to make a twenty-minute talk.</p>
<p>Vance was delighted to do so. He felt it would give
him prestige. But, unfortunately, he wrote out and
memorized his talk. He rehearsed forty times in front
of a mirror. He had everything down pat: every
phrase, every gesture, every facial expression. It was
flawless, he thought.</p>
<p>However, when he stood up to deliver his address,
he was terrified. He said: “My part in this program
is… .” His mind went blank. In his confusion, he
took two steps backward and tried to start all over
again. Again, his mind went blank. Again he took two
steps back and tried to start. He repeated this performance
three times. The platform was four feet high;
there was no railing at the back; and there was a space
five feet wide between the back of the platform and the
wall. So, the fourth time he stepped back, he toppled
backwards off the platform and disappeared into space.
The audience howled with laughter. One man fell off
his chair and rolled in the aisle. Never before nor since
in the history of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
has anyone ever given such a comic performance. The
astonishing part of the story is that the audience
thought it was really an act. The old-timers of the
Equitable Life are still talking about his performance.</p>
<p>But what about the speaker, Vance Bushnell? Vance
Bushnell himself told me it was the most embarrassing
occasion of his life. He felt so disgraced that he wrote
out his resignation.</p>
<p>Vance Bushnell’s superiors persuaded him to tear up
his resignation. They restored his self-confidence; and
Vance Bushnell, in later years, became one of the most
effective speakers in his organization. But he never
memorized a talk again. Let us profit by his experience.
I have heard countless scores of men and women try
to deliver memorized talks, but I don’t remember even
one speaker who wouldn’t have been more alive, more
effective, more human, if he had tossed his memorized
talk into the waste baskets If he had done that, he
might have forgotten some of his points. He might
have rambled, but at least he would have been human.
Abe Lincoln once said: “I don’t like to hear a cutand-
dried sermon. When I hear a man preach, I like to
see him act as if he were fighting bees.” Lincoln said
he wanted to hear a speaker cut loose and get excited.
No speaker ever acts as if he were fighting bees when
he is trying to recall memorized words.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2.2.2. </span>ASSEMBLE AND ARRANGE YOUR IDEAS BEFOREHAND<a class="headerlink" href="#assemble-and-arrange-your-ideas-beforehand" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>What, then, is the proper method of preparing a
talk? Simply this: search your background for significant
experiences that have taught you something about
life, and assemble your thoughts, your ideas, your convictions,
that have welled up from these experiences.
True preparation means brooding over your topics. As
Dr. Charles Reynold Brown said some years ago in a
memorable series of lectures at Yale University:
“Brood over your topic until it becomes mellow and
expansive … then put all these ideas down in writing,
just a few words, enough to fix the idea … put them
down on scraps of paper—you will find it easier to arrange
and organize these loose bits when you come to
set your material in order.” This doesn’t sound like
such a difficult program, does it? It isn’t. It just requires
a little concentration and thinking to a purpose.</p>
</section>
<section id="rehearse-your-talk-with-your-friends">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2.2.3. </span>REHEARSE YOUR TALK WITH YOUR FRIENDS<a class="headerlink" href="#rehearse-your-talk-with-your-friends" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Should you rehearse your talk after you have it in
some kind of order? By all means. Here is a sure-fire
method that is easy and effective. Use the ideas you
have selected for your talk in everyday conversation
with your friends and business associates. Instead of
going over the ball scores, just lean across the luncheon
table and say something like this: “You know, Joe, I
had an unusual experience one day. I’d like to tell you
about it.” Joe will probably be happy to listen to your
story. Watch him for his reactions. Listen to his response.
He may have an interesting idea that may be
valuable. He won’t know that you are rehearsing your
talk, and it really doesn’t matter. But he probably will
say that he enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>Allan Kevins, the distinguished historian, gives similar
advice to writers: “Catch a friend who is interested
in the subject and talk out what you have learned at
length. In this way you discover facts of interpretation
that you might have missed, points of arguments that
had been unrealized, and the form most suitable for the
story you have to tell.”</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.2.2.3. </span>THIRD: PREDETERMINE YOUR MIND TO SUCCESS<a class="headerlink" href="#third-predetermine-your-mind-to-success" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In the first chapter, you remember, this sentence was
used in reference to building the right attitude toward
public speaking training in general. The same rule applies
to the specific task now facing you, that of making
each opportunity to speak a successful experience.
There are three ways to accomplish this:</p>
<section id="lose-yourself-in-your-subject">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2.3.1. </span>LOSE YOURSELF IN YOUR SUBJECT<a class="headerlink" href="#lose-yourself-in-your-subject" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>After you have selected your subject, arranged it according
to plan, and rehearsed it by “talking it 0^”
with your friends, your preparation is not ended. You
must sell yourself on the importance of your subject.
You must have the attitude that has inspired all the
truly great personages of history—a belief in your
cause. How do you fan the fires of faith in your
message? By exploring all phases of your subject,
grasping its deeper meanings, and asking yourself how
your talk will help the audience to be better people for
having listened to you.</p>
</section>
<section id="keep-your-attention-off-negative-stimuli-that-may-upset-you">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2.3.2. </span>KEEP YOUR ATTENTION OFF NEGATIVE STIMULI THAT MAY UPSET YOU<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-your-attention-off-negative-stimuli-that-may-upset-you" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>For instance, thinking of yourself making errors of
grammar or suddenly coming to an end of your talk
somewhere in the middle of it is certainly a negative
projection that could cancel confidence before you
started. It is especially important to keep your attention
off yourself just before your turn to speak.
Concentrate on what the other speakers are saying,
give them your wholehearted attention and you will not
be able to work up excessive stage fright.</p>
</section>
<section id="give-yourself-a-pep-talk">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2.3.3. </span>GIVE YOURSELF A PEP TALK<a class="headerlink" href="#give-yourself-a-pep-talk" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Unless he is consumed by some great cause to which
he has dedicated his life, every speaker will experience
moments of doubt about his subject matter. He will ask
himself whether the topic is the right one for him,
whether the audience will be interested in it. He will be
sorely tempted to change his subject. At times like
these, when negativism is most likely to tear down
self-confidence completely, you should give yourself a
pep talk. In clear, straightforward terms tell yourself
that your talk is the right one for you, because it comes
out of your experience, out of your thinking about life.
Say to yourself that you are more qualified than any
member of the audience to give this particular talk and,
by George, you are going to do your best to put it
across. Is this old-fashioned Coue teaching? It may be,
but modern experimental psychologists now agree that
motivation based on autosuggestion is one of the strongest
incentives to rapid learning, even when simulated.
How much more powerful, then, will be the effect of a
sincere pep talk based on the truth?</p>

<section id="fourth-act-confident">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.2.2.4. </span>FOURTH: ACT CONFIDENT<a class="headerlink" href="#fourth-act-confident" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The most famous psychologist that America has produced, Professor William James, wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.</p>
<p>Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can.</p>
<p>So, to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all of our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Apply Professor James’ advice. To develop courage
when you are facing an audience, act as if you already
had it. Of course, unless you are prepared, all the acting
in the world will avail but little. But granted that
you know what you are going to talk about, step out
briskly and take a deep breath. In fact, breathe deeply
for thirty seconds before you ever face your audience.
The increased supply of oxygen will buoy you up and
give you courage. The great tenor, Jean de Reszke,
used to say that when you had your breath so you
“could sit on it” nervousness vanished.</p>
<p>Draw yourself up to your full height and look your
audience straight in the eyes, and begin to talk as confidently
as if every one of them owed you money.
Imagine that they do. Imagine that they have assembled
there to beg you for an extension of credit. The
psychological effect on you will be beneficial.</p>
<p>If you doubt that this philosophy makes sense, you
would change your mind after a few minutes’ conversation
with almost any of the class members who have
preceded you in following the ideas on which this book
is based. Since you can’t talk to them, take the word of
an American who will always be a symbol of courage.
Once he was the most timorous of men; by practicing
self-assurance, he became one of the boldest; he was
the trust-busting, audience-swaying, Big-Stick-wielding
President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>“Having been a rather sickly and awkward boy,” he
confesses in his autobiography, “I was, as a young
man, at the first both nervous and distrustful of my
powers. I had to train myself painfully and laboriously
not merely as regards my body but as regards my soul
and spirit.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, he has disclosed how he achieved the
transformation. “When a boy,” he wrote, “I read a
passage in one of Marryat’s books which always
impressed me. In this passage, the captain of some
small British man-of-war is explaining to the hero how
to acquire the quality of fearlessness. He says that at
the outset almost every man is frightened when he goes
into action, but that the course to follow is for the man
to keep such a grip on himself that he can act just as if
he were not frightened. After this is kept up long
enough, it changes from pretense to reality, and the
man does in very fact become fearless by sheer dint of
practicing fearlessness when he does not feel it.</p>
<p>“This was the theory upon which I went. There were
all kinds of things of which I was afraid at first, ranging
from grizzly bears to ‘mean’ horses and gunfighters;
but by acting as if I were not afraid I
gradually ceased to be afraid. Most men can have the
same experience if they choose.”</p>
<p>Overcoming fear of public speaking has a tremendous
transfer value to everything that we do. Those
who answer this challenge find that they are better persons
because of it. They find that their victory over
fear of talking before groups has taken them out of
themselves into a richer and fuller life.</p>
<p>A salesman wrote: “After a few times on my feet
before the class, I felt that I could tackle anyone. One
morning I walked up to the door of a particularly
tough purchasing agent, and before he could say ‘no/ I
had my samples spread out on his desk, and he gave
me one of the biggest orders I have ever received.”</p>
<p>A housewife told one of our representatives: “I was
afraid to invite the neighbors in for fear that I wouldn’t
be able to keep the conversation going. After taking a
few sessions and getting up on my feet, I took the
plunge and held my first party. It was a great success. I
had no trouble stimulating the group along interesting
lines of talk.”</p>
<p>At a graduating class, a clerk said: “I was afraid of
the customers, I gave them a feeling that I was apologetic.
After speaking to the class a few times, I found
that I was speaking up with more assurance and poise,
I began to answer objections with authoritativeness.
My sales went up forty-five per cent the first month after
I started to speak to this class.”</p>
<p>They discovered that it was easy to conquer other
fears and anxieties and to be successful where before
they may have failed. You, too, will find that speaking
in public will enable you to face what each day
presents with a sure touch that confidence brings. You
will be able to meet the problems and conflicts of life
with a new sense of mastery. What has been a series of
insoluble situations can become a bright challenge to
increased pleasure in living.</p>
